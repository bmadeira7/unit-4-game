# unit-4-game
I made a game modeled after the "crystal collector" game. 

The computer generates a random number. Each image of the casts members from the Tv show "Sunny in Philadelphia" are
given a random value. When the user clicks on a picture that random value is added to the current score. 

The goal of the game is to match the pre-determined number with your current score. If the user suceeds, the wins counter
will register than win. If the user exceeds the pre-determined number, the losses counter will register that loss.
